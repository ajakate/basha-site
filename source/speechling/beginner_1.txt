And you?
No.
Really?
Great.
Help!
Please.
Yes.
Stop!
I know.
Maybe.
A little.
That way.
A few.
Of course.
On the right.
Okay.
Which one?
"That's it."
Certainly!
I like it.
What is that?
Who is that?
What is it?
Why not?
Who is it?
"It's there."
On the left.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Hello.
I remember.
I understand.
All day.
Try it.
Over there.
"I'm good."
Who are you?
"Isn't it?"
Right there.
Where is it?
Not yet.
It works.
Have you been?
"It's here."
Here it is.
Everyday.
How are you?
I forget.
One like that.
How many?
I love you.
Tell me.
Call me.
I agree.
Over here.
Forget it.
Where is he?
Hurry!
Where are you?
Next time.
"What's this?"
Cheers!
Here you are.
Right here.
I think so.
Nonsense.
"Don't do that."
Who are they?
Is that enough?
"You're right."
I believe you.
Is it free?
"That's right."
Just a little.
"I'm full."
More than that.
Come here.
Follow me.
Not recently.
"I don't know."
"What's in it?"
I have money.
Is it possible?
Is it close?
Well done!
"I'm single."
Where were you?
Are you sure?
At what time?
Try it on.
I was wrong.
"I'm happy."
What happened?
The light is on.
"What's up?"
What size?
Who won?
Is it ready?
"I'm sorry."
"I'm ready."
Good idea.
Is that ok?
Good morning.
Take care.
I trust you.
Be quiet.
I give up.
Yes, really.
He thinks.
Looks good.
"It's ok."
The whole day.
"I'm ok."
Be careful.
Which is better?
Waiter!
Is it hot?
Never mind.
I believe in you.
"That's enough."
Eleven minus three is eight.
Turn right.
Are they the same?
"I'm cold."
"I'm married."
Waitress!
Every week.
Just a moment.
"I'm good, and you?"
Are you ready?
"That's wrong."
"They're the same."
What time is it?
"I don't like it."
"Let's go."
I feel good.
"I'm sick."
From time to time.
