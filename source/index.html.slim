			p.mb-4 There is a long history of immigrants facing pressure to assimilate when they come to America. For too long, our educations systems placed a misinformed emphasis on immigrant children speaking only English at home. As those children grew into adulthood, many found themselves completely divorced from their mother tongue.
			p.mb-4 Basha exists to help children of immigrants recover mother tongues that are less common and not covered by traditional language-learning apps. We reconnect families that have been separated by linguistic barriers by empowering our users with tools to implement science-backed methods of language learning.
			p.mb-4 Basha is 100% free for all users. We believe in celebrating the immigrant experience, including our rich multi-lingual histories. Also, and you'll have to excuse our blasphemy, we don't believe that everything on the internet has to be monetized ðŸ˜‰.
